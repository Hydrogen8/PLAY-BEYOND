[errorCodes]
80010007 = This error occurs when SPE cannot execute `main()` function inside ELF. Either bad ELF or not enough memory available. Can also be caused by ELF version being too new for the current FW. 
80010008 = Not enough RAM available to do the operation. Restart LV2 or do a full hardware reboot to fix. 
80010009 = Operation not permitted. Debug ELF on CEX. ,
8001000A = Device or resource busy. Not enough RAM to call `CellFsManager` or device was removed during index call. 
8001000B = Operation timed out. 
8001000C = Operation failed or canceled. 
8001000D = Invalid memory access (LV2 tried to access LV1 memory space, can also cause a kernel panic) 
80010019 = System version error. Caused by non patched downgrate on 3.55 or QA Flag is not set. 
80010017 = This error is caused by bad signing in ELF, downgrade or resign to fix. Can also be caused by corrupt headers in ELF (sceversion, scesign, ect) 
8001001A = Similar to 80010017, but is only caused by corrupted headers (man made failure) 
8001003D = Pointer is null. If happens with BD game, check PARAM.SFO is present and does not require install disc. 

[sysconCodes]
1001 = Related to early CellBringUp() cycle fault, could be CELL/NEC tokins.
1002 = Related to RSX POWER FAILURE, this is a NEC/PSU issue. Can also be caused by bad BGA.
1004 = AC/DC power fault. Replace PSU.
1103 = Thermal alert. Replace thermal compound. Can also occure when the CELL tempature monitor has gone bad (rare) This is a Mulion errorm code only.
1200 = Thermal alert. Replace thermal compound. This is related to CELL/BE. Happens on all models. Can be related to failure on `IC1101` IC chip. Replace `AD51/007Z-0REEL`.
1201 = Thermal alert. Replace thermal compound. This is related to RSX. Happens on all models. Can be related to failure on `IC2101` IC chip.
1203 = Thermal alert. Replace thermal pads. This is related to CELL VR (voltage regulator). Happens on `TMU-520, COK-001, COK-002` motherboards ONLY.
1204 = Thermal alert. Replace thermal pad. This is related to Southbridge.
1205 = Thermal alert. Replace thermal pads. This is related to EE/GS (COK-001/COK-002)
1301 = `CELL PL Unlock`. CELL DIE is damaged.
14FF = `Check Stop`. Occures on consoles with YLOD while system was on. Similar to BE DEADLOCK, but is hardware related.
1601 = `CELL LIVELOCK DETECTION`. CELL cannot proceed with code exection. Can be software/hardware related. Can be related to bad RSX (if proceeded with graphical artifacting).
1701 = `CELL BE ATTENTION`. BE ATTENTION is an active-high output flag sent by the CPU to the SYSCON. During initialization & configuration it is used to request an operation by the SYSCON. When ATTN goes High the syscon reads the SPI Status Register to determine the cause of the Attention signal. It remains high until software resets the condition that caused it. After Power On Reset the BE attention signal is driven low and is supposed to stay there! If there is a Checkstop error (14FF), Livelock Detection (1601), or PLL Unlock (1301) the CPU enters a fault condition and raises the Attention signal (1701) during operation. The SYSCON sees this and immediately shuts the console down with error code A0801701 and usually another error indicating the cause. One common way this happens is when a solder connection breaks while the system is on. This could be the BGA (Ball Grid Array) or the Solder Bumps under the die. (taken directly from PS3DevWiki)
